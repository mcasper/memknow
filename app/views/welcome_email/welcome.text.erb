Hey there!

You signed up for Memknow. You must be pretty smart!

Memknow is an easy way to study without cramming and actually remember the material after the test. The way it works is simple. You create a flashcard. We'll send you a reminder to study it right before you forget it. You take a look at it whenever you have a minute to kill and tell us how you did. That's it.

The magic of Memknow isn't apparent at first, so please give it a month before judging. You'll only have to study a flashcard for a total of 30 seconds to remember it for 3 years! So if a piece of info will cost you more than 2 minutes during your life, Memknow is your friend.

I hope you learn more and stress less. If anything is on your mind, just hit reply.

Sincerely,
Eric
